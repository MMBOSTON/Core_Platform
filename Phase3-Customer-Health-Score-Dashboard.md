    *   The effort required is balanced and achievable within the 7-10 day timeframe, especially with a focus on delivering a functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The project can start with a basic version and iterate based on feedback.

### Leveraging Pre-existing Packages:

To expedite development, the team should leverage pre-existing packages and tools from sources like GitHub:

1.  **Dashboard Frameworks:**
    
    *   Utilize frameworks such as Grafana, Kibana, or build custom dashboards with libraries like D3.js or Plotly. These tools provide robust features for creating interactive and visually appealing dashboards.
2.  **Data Integration:**
    
    *   Use ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools such as Apache NiFi or Talend for seamless data integration from various sources. These tools simplify the process of consolidating data from different systems.
3.  **Data Storage:**
    
    *   Utilize existing databases like PostgreSQL or MongoDB to store and manage the integrated data efficiently.

### Implementation Plan for Customer Health Score Dashboard:

1.  **Requirement Gathering:**
    
    *   Define key metrics for customer health, such as usage frequency, support tickets, and Net Promoter Scores (NPS). Collaborate with stakeholders to ensure these metrics align with business goals.
2.  **Data Integration:**
    
    *   Integrate data from various sources like CRM systems, support ticketing systems, and customer feedback tools. Ensure data is cleaned and formatted for consistent analysis.
3.  **Dashboard Development:**
    
    *   Develop an interactive dashboard to visualize customer health scores. Use existing visualization libraries to create a user-friendly interface that allows stakeholders to easily interpret the data.
4.  **Testing:**
    
    *   Ensure data accuracy and dashboard functionality through rigorous testing. Validate that the dashboard provides accurate insights and is reliable under different conditions.
5.  **Deployment:**
    
    *   Deploy the dashboard and ensure it is accessible to relevant stakeholders. Provide training if necessary to help users understand and utilize the dashboard effectively.

### Conclusion:

By focusing on the Customer Health Score Dashboard, the project will deliver high value to the business with a manageable development effort. This choice aligns with the project constraints and priorities, ensuring a successful initial implementation within the given timeframe.
