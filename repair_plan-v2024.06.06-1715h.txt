Snapshot (commit) current codebase to preserve FASTAPI parts that are working.
PROBLEMS: 
    Database schema / recipe layer is out of sync with the Python DB access FastAPI routes and their correspoding functions .  

    Python objects do not reflect the database table and column names.

GOAL for this commit:
    - create a snapshot of what works (to roll back here if changes FUBAR everything)

Create new branch called "fix_PyDB_layer"
Fix dbmap_bad parts, then commit repaired version as "goodmaster"

FastAPI routes (endpoints) infrastructure

Snowfakery recipe (YAML schema used for generating SQL data objects, NOT entire database)
Snowfakery SQL code generator (generates the actual database schema AND the SQL instance data)


database schema (SQL schema)  
    SQLAlchemy Object-Relational Mapper (maps Python objects to SQL tables)

Python functions that map data from the database to the FastAPI endpoints
